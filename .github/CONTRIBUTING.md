## Git Commit Guidelines
We are following [AngularJS's commit message convention](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines) also known as [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog).

We use the [Commitizen CLI wizard](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli). To use the wizard, run `yarn run commit` after staging your changes.
